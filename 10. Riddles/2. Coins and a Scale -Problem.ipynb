    "<p>You have <b>eight coins</b> and a <b>two-pan scale</b>. All the coins weigh the same, except for one which is heavier than all the others. The coins are otherwise indistinguishable. You may make no assumptions about how much heavier the heavy coin is. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be certain of identifying the heavy coin?</p>"

    "<p>As we have total 8 coins, divide the coins into three groups. Group 1 and 2 containing 3 coins and Group 3 containing the left over 2 coins. Now measure Group 1 and Group 2 on pan scales. If they both weight the same, it means that the heavy coin is in the Group 3. Now you can weight both the 2 coins of Group 3 and find the heavier coin.</p>\n",

    "<p>If on the other hand, when you are weighting Group 1 and 2 and found that one of the group of coins is heavier than the other. So you can eliminate all the other groups coins and weight only that group coins(3 coins) by selecting any two of them and weight them against each other. If both pans weights the same it means the heavier coin is the one which is not measured.</p>\n",
